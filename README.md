# 🚕 CAB BOOKING SYSTEM  
**Microservices-based, Event-driven & Real-time Ride Hailing Platform**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents the **analysis, design, and implementation** of a modern **Cab Booking System** built on a **Microservices architecture**, aiming to address challenges of:

- Scalability  
- Reliability  
- Real-time processing  
- Fault tolerance  

The system follows **cloud-native principles**, is deployed on **multiple virtual machines**, and leverages **event-driven communication** to decouple services and improve resilience.

This project simulates how large-scale ride-hailing platforms (e.g., **Grab, Uber**) handle **high-concurrency booking requests** and **real-time trip updates**.

📚 **Academic usage**:
- System Architecture Design
- Distributed Systems / Big Data
- Microservices & Cloud-native demonstration

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Design a distributed Cab Booking System using **Microservices**
- Implement **event-driven communication**
- Support **real-time trip status updates**
- Ensure **horizontal scalability & fault isolation**
- Deploy services across **multiple Virtual Machines**
- Apply **industry-standard architectural patterns**

---

## 🧩 System Scope (MVP)

The **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** focuses on core ride-hailing features:

- User & Driver authentication
- Cab booking request creation
- Driver matching (rule-based)
- Trip lifecycle management
- Real-time trip status notification
- Basic monitoring & logging

❗ **Excluded (intentionally)**:
- Payment processing
- AI pricing
- Route optimization

---

## 🏗️ Overall System Architecture

The system adopts a **Microservices + Event-driven architecture**, where each service is independently deployable and scalable.
